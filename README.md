# Raditian Free Hugo Theme
###### Raditian Hugo Theme for Personal Websites

This free Hugo theme is a fork of [Adritian Theme](https://github.com/zetxek/adritian-free-hugo-theme) - a great Hugo theme created by Radity.

It's based on bootstrap (so it's responsive), and the main changes have been upgrades on the web performance and accessibility of the template.

Changes:

- removal of jQuery
- upgrade of bootstrap from v4 to v5
- assets pipeline support
- some basic i18n featurees
- added more pages/templates
